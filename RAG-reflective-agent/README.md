## CRAG (Corrective RAG) 

Corrective-RAG (CRAG) - is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents.
This reduces the amount of distracting information the small LLM has to deal with when generating a final response.

This is a simple implementation of **CRAG** using [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [Ollama](ollama.com) model.
